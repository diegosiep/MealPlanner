# 🔐 API Key Security Implementation Guide

Your API keys are now securely protected using macOS Keychain encryption! This document explains how the new security system works and how to manage your API keys.

## 🛡️ What Was Secured

The following API keys have been moved from hardcoded strings to encrypted keychain storage:

1. **USDA Food Database API Key** - (removed from source code, now stored securely)
2. **Claude AI API Key** - (removed from source code, now stored securely)

## 🔑 How It Works

### Secure Storage
- API keys are encrypted and stored in **macOS Keychain**
- Keys are only accessible to your specific app on your device
- No one can extract keys from your source code anymore
- Keys are protected by macOS security protocols

### Automatic Migration
When you first run the app after this update:
1. The app will detect missing secure keys
2. A setup screen will appear
3. Click "Migrate API Keys to Secure Storage"
4. Your keys will be automatically moved to keychain

## 🚀 First Time Setup

### Option 1: Automatic Migration (Recommended)
1. Run the app
2. You'll see an API Key Setup screen
3. Click "Migrate API Keys to Secure Storage"
4. Done! Your keys are now secure

### Option 2: Manual Entry
If you prefer to enter keys manually:
1. Go to Settings → API Key Setup
2. Enter your USDA API key (get one free from api.nal.usda.gov)
3. Enter your Claude API key (get one from console.anthropic.com)
4. Click "Save API Keys Securely"

## 📁 Files Modified

### New Security Files
- `SecureAPIKeyManager.swift` - Core keychain management
- `APIKeySetupUtility.swift` - Setup UI and utilities

### Updated Files
- `USDAFoodService.swift` - Now uses secure key retrieval
- `ClaudeProvider.swift` - Now uses secure key retrieval  
- `LLMService.swift` - OpenAI and HuggingFace providers secured
- `MealPlannerProApp.swift` - Added setup check on startup

## 🔧 Developer Usage

### Retrieving API Keys in Code
```swift
let keyManager = SecureAPIKeyManager.shared

// Get USDA API key
if let usdaKey = keyManager.usdaAPIKey {
    // Use the key safely
}

// Check if key exists
if keyManager.hasAPIKey(for: .usdaAPI) {
    // Key is available
}
```

### Adding New API Keys
```swift
// Store a new API key
let success = keyManager.storeAPIKey("your-api-key", for: .usdaAPI)

// Retrieve it later
let key = keyManager.retrieveAPIKey(for: .usdaAPI)
```

## 🎯 Status Indicator

The app now shows API key status:
- 🟢 Green dot = API key configured and available
- 🔴 Red dot = API key missing or invalid

Look for this indicator in the top bar:
- USDA 🟢/🔴
- Claude 🟢/🔴

## ⚠️ Important Security Notes

1. **Remove Hardcoded Keys**: After migration, you should remove the hardcoded API keys from source code
2. **Keychain Backup**: Your keys are tied to your device - if you get a new Mac, you'll need to re-enter them
3. **Team Sharing**: Each developer needs their own API keys in their keychain
4. **Source Control**: API keys are no longer visible in git/source control

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "API key not found" Error
1. Check that you've completed the setup process
2. Verify the key status indicator shows green
3. Try manually entering keys in Settings

### Keys Not Migrating
1. Make sure you have the necessary API keys
2. Check macOS Keychain permissions
3. Try manual setup as fallback

### App Won't Start
1. The app now requires USDA API key to function
2. Complete the setup process on first launch
3. Contact support if issues persist

## 🔄 Migration Cleanup

After successful migration, you can safely:
1. Remove the `storeCurrentAPIKeys()` method from `SecureAPIKeyManager.swift`
2. Remove hardcoded key strings from source files
3. The keys will remain secure in keychain

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues with the API key security system:
1. Check this guide first
2. Verify your macOS Keychain is functioning
3. Try manual key entry as backup
4. Contact system administrator if needed
